How to use PyTorch to train a Deep Q Learning (DQN) agent on the CartPole-v0 task from the OpenAI Gym.
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html#


The CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real values representing the
environment state (position, velocity, etc.). However, neural networks can solve the task purely by looking at
the scene, so we’ll use a patch of the screen centered on the cart as an input. Because of this, our results aren’t
directly comparable to the ones from the official leaderboard - our task is much harder. Unfortunately this does slow
down the training, because we have to render all the frames.

Strictly speaking, we will present the state as the difference between the current screen patch and the previous one.
This will allow the agent to take the velocity of the pole into account from one image.
